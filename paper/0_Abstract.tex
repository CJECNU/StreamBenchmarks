Over the past years, Stream data processing is gaining compelling attention both in industry and in academia due to its wide range of applications in various use-cases. To fulfil the need for efficient and high performing  Big data analytics, numerous open source stream data processing systems were developed. Processing data with high throughput while retaining low latency is key performance indicator for such systems. In this paper, we propose a benchmarking system to evaluate the performance of stream  data processing systems, Storm, Spark and Flink  in terms of indicators shown above. More specifically, the latency of windowed aggregation and windowed join operators is evaluated jointly  with the throughput of a system.
