Over the past years, Stream Data Processing is gaining compelling attention both in industry and in academia due to its wide range of applications in various use-cases. To fulfil the need for efficient and high performing  Big Data analytics, numerous open source Stream Data Processing Systems (SDPS) were developed. Processing data with high throughput while retaining low latency is key performance indicator for such systems. In this paper, we propose a benchmarking system to evaluate the performance of SDPSs, Storm, Spark and Flink  in terms of latency and throughput. More specifically, the latency of windowed aggregation and windowed join operators is evaluated jointly  with the throughput of a system. The main goal of this work is to build a benchmarking system for SDPS which is simple because simple is beautiful.  The main contribution of this work is threefold. Firstly, we first define a definition of latency and throughput for stateful operators, based on the industry use-case. Secondly, we completely separate the unit under test and driver. This enables us not only building a simple and transparent system but also empowers the system to be flexible. Finally, we first build a driver to test the sustainability of a unit under test which supports various user defined policies.
